# Challenge Summary

- The challenge is to add a number to an exisitng array

## Challenge Description

- For this challenge we are expected to have an existing array and add a number to it. The array's are two specific lengths so you can't just add the number as you wish. This code would have to speficy where the number is going to be added depending on the length of the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

- My approach is to treat array's as seperate objects, each object has a different length so part of my code will need to probably strict equal to the length of an array. I also need to splice the array so I can add in a value to the array, and with splice I can intsert a specific value. So for me to look at each idex of the array I need to loop through the length and do a comparision to see if the length of the array is equal to an expected value. One of the array's is a total of five numbers and the other is four. I can introduce an if statment and say esle if the array does not meet the first criteria.
