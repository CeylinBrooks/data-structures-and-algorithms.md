# Challenge Summary

- Pseudocode: Merge Sort

## Challenge Description

- Review the provided pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Challenge

- Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
- Convert the pseudo-code into working code in JavaScript
- Present a complete set of working tests

## Testing Parameters

“Happy Path” - Expected outcome
Expected failure
Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)

## Approach & Efficiency

- For this code challenge the goal is to split the suggested values within the array in half and for each half those will be sorted with written code. In a similar fashion to the code challenge for insertion sort, we will use the basics of a For loop to increment through all the values inside of the array.
