# Insertion Sort

- Merge sort is an algorithm based of the idea of finding the lesser value and moving it to the appropriate position. With each sequence the merge sort is broken down into smaller and smaller chunks until all the values are sorted into the ascending order. 

## Steps

- The sample array is [5,3,7,15,11,9,17,19]

Step 1: Split the arrays values into two sections based off of the array.length/2. In this example the values 5,3,7,15 move to the left to be sorted and the values 11,9,17,19 move to the right.

Step 2: With each step into the smaller arrays each value is assessed and sorted into the ascending order.

Step 3: With the values assessed the arrays are merged back together as a unit until the array is completely assembled.
