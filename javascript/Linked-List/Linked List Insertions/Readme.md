# Challenge Summary

- The challenge is to add a number to an exisitng array

## Challenge Description

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

    * .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
    * .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
    * .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency

- Just like creating the linked list in this situation I need to find a spot within the Node to insert the values. Effectivley the node needs to be pulled apart and the value is inserted with node. The new node has to also function like an exsiting node. That is my approach and I will refine as the code progresses.
